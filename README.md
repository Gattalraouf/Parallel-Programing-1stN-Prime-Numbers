# ParallelPrograming1stNPrimeNumbers
Finding the 1st N prime numbers using Sequential, omp, mpi and hybrid algorithms.

## Sequential
* Code stored in "sequ.c".
* Execute sequ to get the results.
## OpenMP
* Code stored in "omp.c".
* Execute omp to get your results.
## Open MPI
* Code stored in "mpi.c".
* It needs tow machines to work.
## Hybrid
* Code stored in "hybrid.c".
* It needs tow machines to work.
